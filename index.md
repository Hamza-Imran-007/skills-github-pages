### [Home Automation System Using Google Assistang]
[(https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app](https://github.com/Hamza-Imran-007/Home-Automation-Using-Google-Assistant))
This project is a comprehensive Home Automation System that enables voice-controlled and sensor-based management of home appliances using Google Assistant, with additional intelligence through temperature monitoring and human presence detection.

🔧 System Overview
🔊 Voice Control via Google Assistant (on mobile)

🔁 Commands sent through IFTTT → Adafruit IO (cloud MQTT)

📡 ESP32 microcontroller receives commands from Adafruit and controls appliances through relays

🌡️ Temperature-Based Fan Automation
Uses a DHT11 sensor to monitor room temperature

Automatically turns on/off fans based on preset temperature thresholds

👥 Human Counting with IR Sensors
Two IR sensors detect entry and exit based on sequential triggering

Tracks the number of people in the room in real-time

Helps optimize power usage based on room occupancy

🖥️ TFT Display for Real-Time Feedback
Displays:

🌡️ Current temperature

📋 Latest voice command received

👥 People count

Offers immediate visual feedback of system status

⚙️ Core Technologies
Google Assistant + IFTTT for voice command integration

Adafruit IO for MQTT-based messaging

ESP32 as the central control unit

Relays to switch AC appliances

DHT11 Sensor for temperature

IR Sensors for presence detection

TFT Display for system feedback

✅ Key Features
Full voice control of appliances using natural speech

Intelligent fan control based on live temperature

Automatic lighting/fan decisions based on people count

User-friendly visual interface via a display

Modular and scalable for additional rooms or devices
